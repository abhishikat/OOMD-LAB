OBJECT ORIENTED MODELLING AND DESIGN

## MODEL-1: Create a class diagram for "Student Information System".

## MODEL-2: Create a class diagram for "Hostel Management System".
The class diagram shall include<br>
(i) Generalization, Composition and Aggregation<br>
(ii) Association end names, Multiplicity<br>
(iii) Bags, Sequences and Ordered qualifications<br>
## MODEL-3: Create a class diagram for "Stock (Inventory) Maintainance System".
1. Develop a problem statement for Stocks (Inventory) Maintenance System<br>
2. Develop a complete IEEE standard SRS document with several requirements.<br>
3. Draw appropriate class diagram. <br>
(The class diagram shall also include delegation approaches (composition) in order to overcome the problems associated with multiple inheritance)<br>
## MODEL-4: Create a class diagram for "Online Shopping System".
1. Develop a problem statement for Online
Shopping System.
2. Develop a complete IEEE standard SRS document with several requirements.
3. Draw appropriate class diagram.
(The class diagram shall also include delegation approaches (composition) in order to overcome the problems associated with multiple inheritance)
## MODEL-5: Create a state model for 
   ### 1.College Information System <br>
   ### 2.Hostel Management System.
   Use nested diagrams, nested states, concurrency (if required)

## MODEL-6 Develop a problem statement for Coffee Vending Machine 
          Develop a complete IEEE standard SRS document with several requirements.
          Draw appropriate class diagram and State diagram.
         (The class diagram shall also include delegation approaches (composition) in order to overcome the problems associated with multiple inheritance
## MODEL-7 Draw appropriate State diagrams for
 ### (i)  Online Shopping System. 
 ### (ii) Stocks (Inventory) Maintenance System
      These diagrams should match with the SRS drafted earlier for these systems.
      
## MODEL-8 Prepare Use Case Diagram, Activity Diagram and Sequence Diagram for the following systems
   ### (i) College Information System
   ### (ii) Hostel Management System
   ### (iii) Stock Maintenance System 
      Upload Use Case Diagram,  Activity Diagram and  Sequence Diagram of College Information System in the College Information System folder. Similarly for (ii) and (iii)
